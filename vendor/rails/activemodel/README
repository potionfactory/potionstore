Active Model
==============

Totally experimental library that aims to extract common model mixins from
ActiveRecord for use in ActiveResource (and other similar libraries).  
This is in a very rough state (no autotest or spec rake tasks set up yet),
so please excuse the mess.  

Here's what I plan to extract:
  * ActiveModel::Observing 
  * ActiveModel::Callbacks
  * ActiveModel::Validations

	# for ActiveResource params and ActiveRecord options
  * ActiveModel::Scoping

	# to_json, to_xml, etc
  * ActiveModel::Serialization

I'm trying to keep ActiveRecord compatibility where possible, but I'm
annotating the spots where I'm diverging a bit.
